Set up FreedomBox using deb packages
====================================

To make sure a FreedomBox can be set up on any architecture
supported by Debian, the code and settings used to configure
packages are gathered in this deb.

The scripts in setup.d/ are executed during installation to install
and configure different parts of the FreedomBox.  Note that most setup
should be done as plinth modules on request of its user, and not
during installation.  These scripts should not make any assumtions
about hostname or encryption keys, as these will be set or generated
on the first boot.

After freedombox-setup is installed, the /usr/lib/freedombox/setup
should be called to finish the setup.  

To create the deb file:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential debhelper devscripts
    cd ~/
    git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/freedombox/freedombox-setup.git
    cd freedombox-setup
    debuild
