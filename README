Set up FreedomBox using deb packages
====================================

To make sure a FreedomBox can be set up on any architecture
supported by Debian, the code and settings used to configure
packages are gathered in this deb.

Note that most setup is done as plinth modules on request of its
user, and not during installation.

To create the deb file:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential debhelper devscripts
    cd ~/
    git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/freedombox/freedombox-setup.git
    cd freedombox-setup
    debuild
