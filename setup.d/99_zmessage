FreedomBox setup completed

Please note:

- For server security, all users except 'root', 'fbx' and those in
  'admin' and 'sudo' groups will be denied console/GUI login access.
  This is recommended for the security of various services running on
  FreedomBox.  Please edit /etc/security/access.conf if you wish to
  remove or alter this restriction.  Also see 'man access.conf'.

- You need to reboot before using FreedomBox to allow first run
  operations to finish.
